    <h1>Hawaiian Burger</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If memorable enough, food can function as a movie's main character. In Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction there is the classic conversation devoted to the name given a Quarter Pounder with cheese in France, the Royale with Cheese. And who can forget Samuel L. Jackson's harassment of Brett and his friends and the corresponding line “Mmm…this IS a tasty burger.” His salivating inflection alone makes one want to find a fast food joint stat. While watching this movie again it occurred to me that I wished I could have my very own Big Kahuna Burger. Now you can too.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef or bison</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons teriyaki sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grill seasoning</li>
            <li>4 pineapple rings (canned or fresh)</li>
            <li>4 pieces bacon, cooked until crisp</li>
            <li>4 slices monterey jack cheese</li>
            <li>Spicy cilantro mayo</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Using your hands, gently mix the ground meat with the teriyaki and grill seasoning in a medium bowl. Be careful not to overwork the mixture as that can toughen the meat. Divide into four quarter-pound patties.</li>
            <li>Grill pineapple slices for approx 1 minute on each side on your grill of choice.</li>
            <li>Cook burgers until desired doneness on a grill of choice: gas, charcoal or even one from George Foreman's empire all work well. Place a piece of bacon on each and then top with a piece of jack cheese to hinge the bacon in place. Top with a grilled pineapple slice and serve on Kaiser rolls spread with Spicy Cilantro Mayo.</li>
        </ol>
